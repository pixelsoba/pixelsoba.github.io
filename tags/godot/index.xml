      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting a lot with Godot GUI to see what it&amp;rsquo;s capable of and to get my hands on it. What better way to do that than to start a small project? Nostalgic for Windows XP, I wanted to make a web export of a Godot project that mimics as well as possible the rendering of this Windows of 2001.

      <description>The Godot game engine offers a flexible but very powerful interface creation system. This system is composed of a set of Nodes inheriting from the Control node. They are all shown in green in the engine.&#xA;Most of the following tips are quite straightforward but are important to understand and master before tackling your Graphical User Interfaces with Godot.&#xA;Summary Tip 1: Anchors VS Margins Tip 2: Always set the MinSize first Tip 3: Remember to use SizeFlags with Containers Tip 4: Use Control node to frame and structure Tip 5: Do not forget the CanvasLayer &amp;hellip; Tip 6: &amp;hellip; nor the ReferenceRect Tip 7: Always use _gui_input(event) Tip 8: Theme or Textures Tip 1: Anchors VS Margins Where Godot&amp;rsquo;s Node2D only work with a Transform (translation, rotation, scale), the Control bring the notion of size and therefore the concept of anchors and margins.</description>
